### 1.0.2-1.19.2-1.0

_Released 2022 Oct 17_

#### Requirements
- **MinecraftForge:** 1.19.2-43.1.1

#### Improvements

- Added an advancement to inform players about the mod. [[GH-4](https://github.com/TheMrMilchmann/TheFenceUnleashed/issues/4)]
  - The advancement is granted the first time a player walks through a fence 
    gate.
  - The advancement grants two leads upon unlock to make it easier to get
    started with the mod.
- Changed the artifact base name to "TheFenceUnleashed" (from "Fency") to avoid
  potential confusion.

#### Fixes

- Fixed a bug that caused the mod's resources to be displayed as incompatible
  with the current Minecraft version.
- Fixed a bug that caused carriage-return characters to be visible in the mod's
  description in some places.
