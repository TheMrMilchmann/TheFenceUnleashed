_Released 2022 Jun 08_

#### Requirements
- **MinecraftForge:** 1.19-41.0.1

#### Overview

**Have you ever been annoyed by that one cow that just didn't want to stay in its pen and managed to get out just before
you could close the fence gate?**

_The Fence Unleashed_ is a small QoL mod that helps in exactly this scenario by preventing mobs that are not leashed
from passing through fence gates. Mobs that are leashed to a fence cannot pass either. The behavior of mobs that cannot
be leashed remains unchanged. If a mob is mounted, the properties of the topmost mob will be considered.
