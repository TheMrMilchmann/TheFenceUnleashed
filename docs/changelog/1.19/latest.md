### 1.0.1-1.19.2-1.0

_Released 2022 Aug 23_

#### Requirements
- **MinecraftForge:** 1.19.2-43.1.1

#### Improvements

- Added MineColonies' citizens (`minecolonies:citizen`) to the default allowlist.
    - This will only take effect for new installations. If you wish to whitelist
      MineColonies' citizens to an existing installation, you will still have to
      add the exception manually.
- Improved documentation for configuration options.

#### Fixes

- Updated an error message to avoid potential confusion.
- Updated the required Forge version indication to the correct requirement.
