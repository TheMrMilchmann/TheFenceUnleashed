### 1.0.2-1.19.2-1.1

_Not Released Yet_

#### Requirements
- **MinecraftForge:** 1.19.2-43.1.1

#### Fixes

- Added MineColonies' visitors (`minecolonies:visitor`) to the default allowlist.
    - This will only take effect for new installations. If you wish to whitelist
      MineColonies' citizens to an existing installation, you will still have to
      add the exception manually.
