## Building from source

### Setup

This project uses [Gradle's toolchain support](https://docs.gradle.org/7.5.1/userguide/toolchains.html)
to detect and select the JDKs required to run the build. Please refer to the
build scripts to find out which toolchains are requested.

An installed JDK 1.8 (or later) is required to use Gradle.

### Building

Once the setup is complete, invoke the respective Gradle tasks using the
following command on Unix/macOS:

    ./gradlew <tasks>

or the following command on Windows:

    gradlew <tasks>

Important Gradle tasks to remember are:
- `clean`                   - clean build results
- `build`                   - assemble and test the Java library
- `runClient`               - runs the development client
- `runServer`               - runs the development server

Additionally `tasks` may be used to print a list of all available tasks.
